# Flotation selectivity before the bench

Founder report: accepted on Anthropic AI for Science Discourse topic 412
(predicting flotation reagent selectivity before the bench). This skill does not
scrape that login wall and does not treat acceptance as a bench result.

This organ lives inside szl-frontier. It does not mint a Space and it does not
mint SZLHOLDINGS/nexus.

## Job

Given a public reagent table plus an optional local bench CSV, emit a rank band
and a receipt. Given declared descriptors and weights, emit an abstaining
unitless prior. S is not recovery.

```text
python rank.py --table reagents.csv
python rank.py --table reagents.csv --bench bench.csv
python prior.py --features features.json --weights weights.json
python -m szl_frontier flotation --table reagents.csv
python -m szl_frontier flotation --features features.json --weights weights.json
```

If any of homo_lumo_gap_eV, dipole_D, surface_charge, pH, collector_mM is
missing, the prior is ABSTAIN. Unset weights ABSTAIN. |2S-1| below tau
(default 0.15) ABSTAIN. S is SIMULATED software, not a measured selectivity.

The rank is a sort of one declared column, `public_score` or `screen_score`.
Bands are tertiles of that order (`high`, `mid`, `low`). Fewer than three rows
are `listed`. The numeric score is not copied into the receipt.

If the bench CSV is missing, the run is MODELED, the directive is DEFER, and
`claims.input` is UNAVAILABLE. A bench file is hashed and may release the
software receipt. It does not create a recovery percent.

## Refuse

- Invented recovery, grade, or selectivity percent
- Using a recovery, grade, or selectivity column as the score (`directive: BLOCK`)
- "Bench-validated" without a row hash
- Cloning Palantir, Anduril, or vendor UI
- Calling Lambda a theorem
- A joule or watt figure from this organ

## Public anchors (not our numbers)

- He et al., Minerals Engineering 2022, QC plus ML screening of collectors
- Separation and Purification Technology 2024, sulfide collector MAE on their set
- AIChE Journal 2025, phosphate flotation screening

Their error bars are not ours.
